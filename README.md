Context
This work focuses on ANOVA, a comparison of means across three or more groups. The procedure was carried out manually in order to gain greater control over the underlying logic and to strengthen the handling of statistical functions. The objective is to evaluate whether there are significant differences in the average voting results by district.

Initial Question: Which political party is leading the election at this point in the day?

Step 1
Group Means The mean represents the average number of votes per district for each party. It is calculated by dividing the total number of votes by the number of observations (districts).

Step 3
Total Sum of Squares (SS_total) This value reflects the total variability in the data, without distinguishing between sources of variation.

Step 4
Between-Groups Sum of Squares (SS_between) This measure captures the variability due to differences between groups (political parties).

Step 5
Within-Groups Sum of Squares (SS_within) This reflects the internal variability of each group, i.e., how dispersed the data are within each party.

Step 6–7
Degrees of Freedom

Between groups: number of groups minus one.

Within groups: total observations minus the number of groups.

Step 8–10
Mean Squares and F-Ratio

The mean square between groups is the average variability across groups.

The mean square within groups is the average internal variability.

The F-ratio evaluates whether the differences between groups are greater than the internal variability.

Step 11
Critical F Value The experimental F value is compared with the critical F value from Fisher’s table (e.g., α = 0.05). If F_experimental > F_critical → reject H₀.

Step 12–14
Pairwise Mean Differences and Tukey’s HSD Pairwise comparisons between parties were calculated. Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) was used to determine which differences are statistically significant.

Final Interpretation
The analysis confirms that there are significant differences in the average voting results by district among several political parties competing in the presidential election. Significant differences were found between:

PLN vs. PUSC

PLN vs. FA

PLN vs. ML

PAC vs. PUSC

PAC vs. FA

PAC vs. ML

FA vs. ML

No significant differences were observed between PLN vs. PAC, PUSC vs. FA, or PUSC vs. ML.

At this point in the day, the PAC party shows the highest average votes per district, positioning it as the most favored in this preliminary analysis.
